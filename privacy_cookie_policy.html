        <h2>About Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We respect your privacy deeply. At present, Octiware does not collect, store, or process any personal data from you. The only information collected is basic technical data (like IP addresses and device type), which our trusted partners Cloudflare and GitHub Pages use solely for security, content delivery, and optimal performance of our website.

        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our website uses cookies solely to ensure that everything works smoothly. Cookies are small data files stored on your device, helping us optimize loading times, maintain security, and provide you with the best browsing experience possible. Currently, we only use cookies provided by Cloudflare and GitHub Pages for performance and security purposes; never to track your personal activity or identity.

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

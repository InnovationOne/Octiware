      <h1>Privacy & Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: March 27, 2025</p>
      <p class="privacy-intro">We respect your privacy. This policy tells you what we collect, how we use it, and what you can do about it.</p>

    <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
    <p>Octiware is an independent game studio based in <span class="highlight">Nürnberg, Germany</span>. When we say "we", "us", or "our", we mean the Octiware team building worlds out of <span class="highlight">pixels and caffeine</span>.</p>
    
    <h3>2. What data we collect</h3>
    <p>We keep things minimal. When you visit our site, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails you send us: When you <span class="highlight">contact us</span>, <span class="highlight">apply for jobs</span>, or <span class="highlight">sign up</span> for something. Voluntarily, of course.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. What we do with your data</h3>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respond to your messages or job applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <span class="highlight">not</span> sell, rent, or share your data with third parties unless required by law.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Cookies & tracking</h3>
    <p>We hate cookie banners too. That’s why we only use cookies when we absolutely must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Essential cookies: For saving language preferences or style/theme selections.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>You can clear or block cookies in your browser settings anytime.<br/>
    We recommend using <span class="highlight">Firefox</span>. It respects your privacy and doesn't treat your data like currency.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Your rights (GDPR & beyond)</h3>
    <p>If you're in the EU (or just privacy-conscious), you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the data we have about you</li>
      <li>Correct or delete it</li>
      <li>Limit or object to how we use it</li>
      <li>File a complaint with a data protection authority</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To do any of this, just email us: <a href="mailto:info@octiware.com">info@octiware.com</a></p>
    
    <h3>6. Data storage & security</h3>
    <p>We store data securely on servers located in the EU. We use encryption, strong passwords, and good coffee-fueled judgment to keep it safe.</p>
        
    <h3>7. Updates to this policy</h3>
    <p>We may tweak this page now and then. Big changes? We’ll let you know. Tiny legal wordings? Probably not.</p>
    
    <h3>8. Questions?</h3>
    <p>If anything’s unclear or you’re worried about data stuff, just reach out: <a href="mailto:info@octiware.com">info@octiware.com</a></p>

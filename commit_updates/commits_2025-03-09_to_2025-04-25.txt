    Building and Animal Building
    
    I have changed the building script to support different buildings. The functionality from the building script has been moved to the targeted Animal Building script. An animal building could be a coop or a barn, for example.
    
    A building now has its own construction phase. In this phase, the building is constructed by the craftsman NPC. He will later construct one building after the other.

    Placeable Objects
    
    Revision of the entire PlaceableObjectManager and all directly and indirectly related scripts.
    
    The following were implemented.
    1. the grid on which the objects can be placed has been halved. It was therefore changed to a 16x16 px field, with a PPU of 32x32. This allows objects to be placed more granularly, e.g. a chair with a distance of 16 px to a table instead of 32 px. On the other hand, objects such as lanterns or fences with a size of 16x16 px can also be placed on the grid.
    2. the synchronization of elements such as a chest content is not generally updated but on demand. For example, if client A places an object in a chest, client B does not yet know about it. As soon as client B opens the chest, this chest asks the server for the latest status and then displays it.
    
    3. fence and gate. Fence and gate now work with game objects with which the player can interact, e.g. open the gate or jump over a fence. On the other hand, they also work directly with the tile map. This makes the functionality much easier, as a RuleTile determines how the fence looks in relation to the other fence elements. So about 300 lines of code were reduced to less than 30.

    Basic NPC Behaviour
    
    This update adds all kinds o basic functionality to create a NPC and have a NPC do its thing.
    
    In detail I've added:
    NPCDefinition: This defines a single character e.g. Kira, it also defines a home and working location as well as character traits, name etc.
    NPCSchedule & NPCScheduleEntry: This defines the daily routine a character is going to follow. This is strict with a location the character has to move to and when he will leave that location and what kind of activity it is.
    This is run by the NPCScheduleRunner.
    The NPC moves with the NPCMovementController and interacts with the NPCInteractionController.
    
    NPCs can even have a quick chat on the go when they see an other NPC or the player.
    
    This update is only the bare minimum to have NPCs in the game and has a lot of potential!

    Continue, New Game and Load Game
    
    This one is a bigger update.
    I've implemented a new version of the continue button. This continues your latest session as per usual but the loading process is started right after starting the game. So whilst the intro is playing the latest session is already loaded for the players convenience.
    
    Next I've added a very simple new game screen that is not finished by all means but from a coding POV its just the character customization missing that since we're most likely changing the character down the line this would be additional work.
    
    Lastly I've added a loading screen when the user can see all of his saved games with some additional information about the save like player name, money, playtime and last played date. In addition to that there is a load, duplicate and delete button for each save.

    Fixed the fade effect on the intro by having the fadeout create the object to begin the intro and have a callback to start the fade out. The is followed by a wait timer since the callback doesn't know the fade duration.

    Replaced the old IntroManager
    
    Replaced the old IntroManager with a new version that is modular and can be changed at any time. It allows for more customization and removes overhead. It creates the intro objects like text, image or video at runtime.
    The text can be changed is stored in variables and can be changed later to support multiple languages.

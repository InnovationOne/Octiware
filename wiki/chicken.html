            Animals fulfill several roles on the farm. Some are wildlife, which cannot be interacted with. 
            A pet (cat, dog, or turtle) can be earned which the player can form a friendship with. 
            A horse can be purchased to ride. And "farm animals" can be purchased which serve as a source of various kinds of produce, providing resources and profit.

Farm animals require a building to house them. These may be obtained from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop, and usually require three days each to build. Baby farm animals (and related equipment needed for harvesting produce) can then be purchased from Marnie's Ranch. Animals may also be hatched from an Incubator. As soon as an animal is acquired, it must be assigned to an existing farm building of the right type, which is designated as its home. Each building has a limit to the number of animals it can house. Animals can be assigned to a different building by first petting it and then interacting with it a second time. A pop-up box appears that allows the reassignment to be made.

Baby farm animals must first mature into adults before they are able to produce animal products. Each morning, adult animals that live in coops (chickens, ducks, rabbits and dinosaurs) have a chance of producing products that can be gathered from the floor of their building. Using the Milk Pail, cows can usually be milked daily, and goats can usually be milked once every two days. Sheep can be shorn with the Shears when their wool grows in, and pigs can be let outside to dig up Truffles that can then be picked up from the barnyard. Ostrichs leave their eggs on barns floor, like coop animals.

            Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the 
            year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are 
            bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population 
            control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment 
            of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, 
            mammal and reptile species.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million 
            cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of 
            adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there 
            were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

            <h2>Senses</h2>
      
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human 
              vision.[51]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects 
              any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's 
              sensitivity to dim light.[67] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has 
              slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration.[68] At low light, 
              a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.[69] The domestic cat has 
              rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and 
              yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited.[70] A response to 
              middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. 
              This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic 
              vision.[71] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their 
              vision.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Hearing</h3>
            <p>
              The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[72] It can detect an 
              extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect 
              frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs 
              can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.[73][74] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large 
              movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It 
              can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.[75][76] 
              Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps 
              of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices.[77]

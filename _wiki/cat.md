The [cat](#){: .highlight } (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the 
domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in 
[archaeology](#){: .highlight } and genetics have shown that the [domestication of the cat](#){: .highlight } 
occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its 
retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, 
quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social 
species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like 
meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear 
sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also 
secretes and perceives pheromones.

Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the 
year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are 
bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population 
control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment 
of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, 
mammal and reptile species.

As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million 
cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of 
adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there 
were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

## Senses

### Vision

Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human 
vision: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects 
any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's 
sensitivity to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has 
slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low light, 
a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. The domestic cat has 
rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and 
yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to 
middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. 
This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic 
vision. Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their 
vision.

### Hearing

The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz. It can detect an 
extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect 
frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs 
can hear ranges of about 9 octaves. Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large 
movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It 
can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.
Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps 
of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices.

Domestic cats are highly social animals, and certain breeds are notably more social...
